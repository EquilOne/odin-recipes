      <h3 class="list-header">Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour (or bread flour for a chewier crust)
        </li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons (9g) salt</li>
        <li>
          0.5 teaspoon (2g) instant dry yeast (or active dry yeast, proofed)
        </li>
        <li>1.5 cups (355ml) lukewarm water</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="list-header">Equipment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Large bowl</li>
        <li>Plastic wrap or a damp towel</li>
        <li>Dutch oven or baking stone with a roasting pan</li>
        <li>Parchment paper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="list-header">Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk
          together the flour and salt. Add the instant dry yeast and stir to
          combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Water:</strong> Pour the lukewarm water into the flour
          mixture. Using a spatula or your hand, mix until a shaggy dough forms.
          Do not knead. Just ensure all the dry ingredients are hydrated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>First Rise (Bulk Fermentation):</strong> Cover the bowl with
          plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let the dough rest at room temperature
          for 12-18 hours. The longer the rise, the more complex the flavor. The
          dough should roughly double in size and have bubbles on the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Lightly flour a clean surface.
          Gently turn the dough out onto the floured surface. The dough will be
          sticky. Lightly flour the top of the dough. Fold the edges of the
          dough toward the center, forming a rough ball. Flip the dough over so
          the seam is down.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Second Rise (Proofing):</strong> Line a bowl with a clean
          kitchen towel or parchment paper and dust it generously with flour (or
          a mix of flour and rice flour). Gently place the dough into the
          prepared bowl, seam side up. Cover with the edges of the towel or
          loosely with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 30-60 minutes, or until it
          has noticeably increased in volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preheat Oven and Dutch Oven:</strong> About 30 minutes before
          baking, preheat your oven to 450°F (232°C). If using a Dutch oven,
          place it in the oven to preheat as well. If using a baking stone,
          place the stone in the oven and place a roasting pan on the rack
          below.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Score the Dough:</strong> Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven
          from the oven. If using a baking stone, have your parchment paper
          ready on a flat surface. Gently invert the dough onto a piece of
          parchment paper or into the hot Dutch oven. Use a sharp knife or a
          lame to score the top of the dough. Scoring helps control the bread's
          expansion and creates a beautiful pattern. A simple "X" or a single
          slash works well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Dutch Oven:</strong> Cover the Dutch oven with its lid and
              return it to the oven. Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on. Remove
              the lid and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is
              golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 205-210°F
              (96-99°C).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Baking stone:</strong> Slide the parchment paper with the
              bread onto the preheated stone. Pour a cup of hot water into the
              roasting pan below to create steam. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove
              the roasting pan. Continue to bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the
              crust is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches
              205-210°F (96-99°C).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cool:</strong> Remove the bread from the Dutch oven or baking
          stone and place it on a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
          This allows the crumb to set.
