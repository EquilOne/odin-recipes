            <li>Potato ricer or masher</li>
            <li>Large mixing bowl</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the Potatoes:</strong> Place the potatoes in a large pot of cold, salted water. Bring to a
                boil and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 25-30 minutes. Drain and let them cool
                slightly.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Peel and Mash:</strong> Once cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes and pass them through a
                potato ricer or mash them thoroughly until smooth.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Form the Dough:</strong> On a clean surface, mound the mashed potatoes. Make a well in the
                center and add the egg and salt. Gradually add the flour, mixing with your hands until a soft, slightly
                sticky dough forms. Do not overwork the dough.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Shape the Gnocchi:</strong> Divide the dough into smaller portions. Roll each portion into a
                long rope about 3/4 inch thick. Cut the rope into 3/4 inch pieces. If desired, gently roll each piece
                over a gnocchi board or the back of a fork to create ridges.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> While you shape the gnocchi, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan
                over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for
                another minute until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Simmer the Sauce:</strong> Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, sugar,
                salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and cook for at least 30 minutes, or longer for a
                richer flavor, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Gnocchi:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the gnocchi into
                the boiling water in batches. They will float to the surface when cooked, about 2-3 minutes. Remove them
                with a slotted spoon and add them directly to the sauce.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Gently toss the gnocchi with the sauce. Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil
                leaves and grated Pecorino Romano cheese, if desired.
            </li>
